# Tesserae Shell: Design Vault

> [!summary]
> Tesserae Shell is a tool for building desktop shell environments (bars, panels, docks, launchers, OSDs, notification centres, widgets) that run alongside KDE Plasma on Wayland. It is built on the **tre** rendering engine, with Python logic and a YAML front-end. This vault holds the complete design. No code is written until the checklist in [[Roadmap]] is `stable` or deferred by an ADR.

Operating rules for agents: [[AGENTS]].

## Start here

| Note | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [[Home]] | Live dashboard: decisions, verification backlog, coverage |
| [[Roadmap]] | Design completeness checklist and phase status |
| [[Open Questions]] | Unknowns and `#needs-verification` items |
| [[Risk Register]] | Technical debt and design hazards |
| [[Glossary]] | Canonical terms |

## Folders

| Folder | Index | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `00 Home` | [[00 Home]] | This note, Glossary, Roadmap, Open Questions, Risk Register |
| `10 Vision` | [[10 Vision]] | Problem statement, goals, non-goals, personas, use cases |
| `20 Architecture` | [[20 Architecture]] | System context, process model, data flow, threading |
| `30 Decisions` | [[30 Decisions]] | ADRs |
| `40 Specifications` | [[40 Specifications]] | Surfaces, modules, runtime, integration |
| `41 YAML Reference` | [[41 YAML Reference]] | Schema for every config key and file type |
| `42 Python API` | [[42 Python API]] | Module and ViewModel contracts, services, events |
| `50 Design System` | [[50 Design System]] | Tokens, components, iconography, motion |
| `60 Quality` | [[60 Quality]] | Budgets, accessibility, testing, security, recovery |
| `70 Delivery` | [[70 Delivery]] | Packaging, install, session integration, release |
| `80 Engine Requests` | [[80 Engine Requests]] | Scoped requests for tre and Tesserae |
| `90 Research` | [[90 Research]] | Prior art, protocol notes, spikes |

> [!warning] Folder indexes pending
> Only `00 Home`, `30 Decisions`, `80 Engine Requests` and `90 Research` have content so far. Only [[80 Engine Requests]] has its folder index; the others do not exist yet, so their links are unresolved. Create each when its folder gets its first note.

## Decisions

| ADR | Status | Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| [[ADR-0001 Shell Surface Strategy]] | proposed | All surface specs |

Research: [[Prior Art - Linux Shell Surfaces]]

Engine requests: [[TRE-REQ-001 Layer Surface Window]] (draft, blocks all surface specs)

Planned, not yet written:
- Relationship to Tesserae UI: depend on `tesserae-ui` or build directly on `tre`
- Coexistence with plasmashell (notifications server, StatusNotifierWatcher)
- Process model: single process or per-surface

## Upstream projects

| Project | Role | Docs | Baseline |
|---|---|---|---|
| tre | Rendering engine (Rust, Python module `tre`) | [docs](https://mindderivative.github.io/tre/) | 0.5.7 |
| Tesserae | Declarative UI framework (`tesserae-ui`) | [docs](https://mindderivative.github.io/tesserae/) | 0.5.1 |

Versions drift. If the live docs disagree with this table, the docs win; update the table.

## Current focus

1. Review [[TRE-REQ-001 Layer Surface Window]] and accept or amend [[ADR-0001 Shell Surface Strategy]]: layer surfaces are the first blocker.
2. Write `10 Vision` (goals, non-goals, v1 scope) so the architecture notes have a target.
3. Seed [[Open Questions]] from the known gaps in [[AGENTS]] §4.
