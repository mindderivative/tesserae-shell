# Tesserae Shell

> [!important] Phase: design only
> A tool for building desktop shells (bars, panels, docks, launchers, OSDs, widgets) that run alongside KDE Plasma on Wayland. Built on the **tre** engine with Python logic and a YAML front-end. No code is written until the [[Roadmap]] checklist is `stable` or deferred by an ADR.

> [!danger] Critical path
> Layer surfaces are the first blocker: without edge anchoring and exclusive zones there is no bar, panel or dock. See [[ADR-0001 Shell Surface Strategy]].

## Decisions

![[Home.base#Decisions]]

Only the maintainer moves an ADR from `proposed` to `accepted`.

## Needs verification

Claims tagged `#needs-verification`. Each must be sourced or listed in [[Open Questions]].

## Recently updated

## Coverage

Which design areas have notes, and how mature they are. A folder missing from the list has not been started.

## Session routine

1. Read [[AGENTS]], [[Index]], [[Open Questions]] and [[Roadmap]].
2. Extend an existing note before creating a new one.
3. Record decisions as `proposed` ADRs, unknowns in [[Open Questions]], risks in [[Risk Register]].
4. Commit locally after each task. Never push without an explicit instruction.
